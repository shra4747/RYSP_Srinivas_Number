This section provides an introduction to some of the main types of
writing that you will encounter at college and university. It will help you
to prepare well-planned essays, reports, summaries, and other
assignments, and also offers useful advice on note-taking, referencing,
and plagiarism.

7 E s s ay s a n d d i s s e r tat i o n s
As a student, you will ﬁnd that it is essential to master the skill of
writing well-reasoned, articulate, and well-presented essays. You will
usually need to write essays as part of your coursework and in exams,
and you may also be required to submit a dissertation (also called an
extended essay or a thesis) in order to achieve a degree or similar
qualiﬁcation.
As you progress in your course of study, you will realize that, in addition
to being crucial to gaining good grades and therefore a good
qualiﬁcation, successful essay-writing is also vital to successful learning.
Once you have developed the ability to analyse an issue, research it,
outline an argument and consider opposing arguments in a coherent
way, give evidence for your viewpoint, and reach a conclusion, you
should have gained a much clearer understanding of your subject in the
process. You will also ﬁnd that such skills will stand you in good stead in
your working life.

Coursework essays
The main purpose of an essay is to provide a formal framework which
will enable your tutors to assess your ability to construct a reasoned
argument and to evaluate your understanding of an aspect of your
subject. You are likely to be asked to write essays as part of your
coursework or in an exam (there is more information on Writing in
Exams on page 53).
It is likely that you will need to complete a number of essays during a
course of study. Many tutors will give you instructions as to the length
of an essay, and you should follow a structured format; you will ﬁnd
guidelines on this in the Writing the essay section below. Of course,
different subjects require different approaches; there is no one way of
writing in higher education and tutors may often have their own ideas
as to what constitutes a good essay. If you are unsure as to what is

expected of you, it is a good idea to discuss what your tutor is looking
for in your writing before you begin. The following guidelines are
intended to serve as a general model for essays which can be adapted to
the speciﬁc needs of your course.

Writing an essay can be thought of as a process, and as such you may
ﬁnd it helpful to break down the task of essay-writing into a number of
stages. Here is a suggested approach to follow.

Planning your time

INSTR

Writing is a complex developmental process as well as a ﬁnal product
and everyone constructs an essay in different ways. Some students ﬁnd
that they have actually to start writing a ﬁrst draft before they have a
concept of what the ﬁnal essay will be like, in order to discover what
they are thinking. Others ﬁnd that they can make notes and construct a
plan from those notes at an earlier stage in their thinking.

analyse

Whatever kind of a writer you are, writing a schedule or action plan for
each essay will help you to manage your time. The following example of
a schedule gives you an outline of the types of activities you need to
consider and it is particularly useful for someone who is able to prepare
an essay in speciﬁc stages.

Hand in essay

As you become more experienced in academic study you will come to
develop your own learning style and be able to assess how long you need
to spend on these tasks. However, you should always leave yourself
plenty of time for preparing and completing the essay.
Understanding the essay question
As your ﬁrst step in preparing for the essay, take some time to think
about what the question means and what you are being asked to do. You
may think that the question looks straightforward and want to charge
straight in and begin reading, or even writing a ﬁrst draft of your essay.

Dear Ms Roberts
Vacancy for Business Analyst
I am writing in reply to your advert for the above post, which appeared in The Guardian
on Tuesday 30 April 2007, and I enclose my CV in application.
I am currently in the final year of a BA (Hons) course in Business Economics at City
University, Bristol, and will graduate next month. I have always wanted to pursue a
career as an economist within an international environment and have been able to tailor
my studies to that end. I have obtained A grades in the Economic Data Analysis,
International Economics, and Economics of Business Strategy modules, and am
currently completing a dissertation on the growth of e-commerce in the European
Union. I am fluent in spoken and written Spanish, having built on my A-level proficiency
in that subject when working in Spain and Mexico.
In addition to the qualifications and abilities outlined above, I have kept my IT skills fully
up to date (including MS Excel and Access) and am competent in a wide range of
business data analysis operations. The post also requires someone with good
communications skills who is able to negotiate with corporate clients: I enjoy making
new contacts and establishing relationships with a wide range of people, and have
successfully liaised with Spanish companies when arranging student activities while
working in Seville.
I feel that the position offered would be ideal in giving me the opportunity to use my
education and skills to provide a high level of service for the international client profile
you describe. I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely

Sara Green

Speculative job applications
If you know that you want to work for a particular company but you
have not seen an advert for a suitable vacancy, then you can submit a
speculative job application. This will consist of your CV/résumé, tailored
appropriately to the type of job you are interested in, together with a
covering letter of application.

Preparation
When approaching a prospective employer with a speculative
application, it is vital ﬁrst to build up a thorough background knowledge
of the company and the types of career opportunities it can offer. You
can do this by a number of means:
2 watching out for job adverts that the company publishes in the local,
national, or trade press
2 visiting its website
2 searching for articles about the company or its sector of the industry
in the press or on the Internet
2 talking to people who already work there (your careers adviser may
well be able to put you in touch with former students who have joined
a particular organization)

Once you have done this, you should also ﬁnd out the name of the
correct person or department to send your application to: you could ﬁnd
this out by phoning the company or consulting its website. This will
ensure that your letter or email does not get mislaid or passed over.
Composing the application letter/email
Read through the advice given in Composing the letter on page 70: all
these points also apply for a speculative job application letter or email.
In addition, you will need to:
2 state at the outset who you are and what type of job you are interested
in
2 say why you are particularly interested in working for the
organization
2 outline what you can offer, focusing on speciﬁc skills, qualiﬁcations,
or personal qualities

You could then ﬁnish your letter by stating when you would be available
for work or for interview, or, in the event of no suitable vacancies being
currently available, by asking the company to keep your details on ﬁle
should any arise in the future. If you are applying by letter, you could
enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope to increase your chances of a
response.

Further action
If you are making a number of speculative applications to different
organizations, make sure that you keep a copy of each letter/email and
CV/résumé. You should also keep a list of companies whom you have
contacted, together with a note of when you contacted them and what
the outcome of your approach was, if any. If you are offered a job, it is
